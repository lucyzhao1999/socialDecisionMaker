A computational model of human morality and fairness using first-principle Bayesian statistics

UCLA Visual Intelligence Lab, advised by Dr. Tao Gao http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/

Humans are sensitive to social judgements.  
Our choices in allocating resources are influenced by how we believe others will perceive our behavior, which can be seen as an introspective theory of mind.   

The model has three layers: 
  1. Base decision maker: base utility combining utility of efficience and inequity
  2. Judge: Bayesian inference on partiality
  3. Constructed social preference: Action taking into consideration both base utility and possible partiality judgement
  
This model is inspired by social preferences and bases its calculation on efficiency and impartiality using first-principle Bayesian statistics.
