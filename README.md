A computational model of human morality and fairness using first-principle Bayesian statistics

Humans are sensitive to social judgements.  
Our choices in allocating resources are influenced by how we believe others will perceive our behavior, which can be seen as an introspective theory of mind.   
This model is inspired by social preferences and bases its calculation on efficiency and impartiality using first-principle Bayesian statistics.
